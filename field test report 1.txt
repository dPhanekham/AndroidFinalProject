took app for a walk around campus

things that worked

-drawing the route where you walked worked


errors

-gps turns off when screen turns off

-when loose gps signal, sets location to coarse location

I NEED TO
-find a way to continue getting location when screen is off or something

-check for infeasible distance (dont log those points)
-increase space between points
-do something about coarse location
